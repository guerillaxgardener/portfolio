      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name's Michael Maker; I'm a software developer with four years of experience as an electronic technician and two years experience leading a team of 28 electronic technicians. I figured out during this time that I love working in tech, but that I'm not motivated by old technology and to keep that running, but instead to be designing and creating the technology of tomorrow. I think that as I enter into the field I'll be able to bring troubleshooting, problem-solving and attention detail from my time as a technician and to bring problem management-level thinking from my time leading a large team, additionally I'll bring enthusiasm and drive to learn and perform well in the position I fit into.
